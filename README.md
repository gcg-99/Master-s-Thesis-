Master's Thesis called "ENVIRONMENTAL ASSOCIATION MODELLING WITH LOCI UNDER SELECTION TO INFER ADAPTIVE THRESHOLDS IN THE HUMAN GENOME" in the basis of a greater project
The main objective is to infer the range of environmental occupation of the human species taking into account only its genetic variability. Moreover, we would like to find the optimal genotypes adapted to particular environmental conditions.
